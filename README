Just a personal tool.
It parses the html code immediately to give a preview.

Require:    MathJax and SyntaxHigjlight plugins(Download and setup yourself)
            jQuery(Already have one, you may use another version)
            webox(I found it on the Internet somewhere)
            a container(body, div, etc...) whose id is "preview" in your page
